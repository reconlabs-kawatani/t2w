# ScaleCrafter - Contribution Guide ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the ScaleCrafter project! We value and appreciate your contributions. Here's how you can get involved:

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**

   Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the [ScaleCrafter repository](https://github.com/YingqingHe/ScaleCrafter-ptl) to create your copy of the project.

2. **Clone Your Fork**

   Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command. Replace `YourUsername` with your GitHub username.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ScaleCrafter-ptl.git
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch**

   Create a new branch for your contribution. This helps keep your work separate and organized.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

   Choose a descriptive branch name that describes your work.

4. **Contribute Like a Pro**

   Work your magic! Write code, fix issues, or add new features following the project's guidelines. Make sure your code aligns with the existing coding style.

5. **Commit Your Work**

   Save your changes to your branch using git commits. Replace `"Your meaningful commit message"` with a clear description of your changes.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your meaningful commit message"
   ```

   Keep your commits focused and concise.

6. **Sync with Upstream (Optional)**

   If your fork becomes outdated, you can sync it with the original repository by adding a remote called `upstream` and merging the changes.

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/YingqingHe/ScaleCrafter-ptl.git
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request**

   Head over to the original ScaleCrafter repository and open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch. Our maintainers will review your work.

8. **Review and Collaboration**

   Your PR will go through a thorough review and testing process. Collaboration is encouraged to enhance your contribution.

9. **Celebrate ðŸŽ‰**

   Once your contribution is approved, it will be merged into ScaleCrafter. Thank you for making ScaleCrafter even better!

Your efforts are highly appreciated. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ¦„
